    Boba, also known as bubble tea, pearl milk tea, or tapioca milk tea, is a beloved Taiwanese beverage that has gained worldwide popularity since its inception in the early 1980s. This unique drink combines tea, milk, and chewy tapioca pearls, creating a refreshing and textural experience. The "bubbles" or "boba" are typically made from tapioca starch, which is extracted from cassava roots, and are cooked with brown sugar to achieve their signature dark caramel color and sweet taste. Boba tea's popularity has spread far beyond its origins in Taiwan, becoming a cultural phenomenon in many countries, particularly among Asian American communities in the United States. The drink's appeal lies not only in its diverse flavors and customizable options but also in its unique drinking experience, which involves using a wide straw to sip both the tea and the chewy pearls simultaneously.
